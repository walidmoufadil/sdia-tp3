# Java Project - Exception Management

This project includes a series of three Java exercises to familiarize oneself with exception handling in an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) context. Each exercise addresses different scenarios where custom exceptions are created and used to manage specific errors. Below is an overview of the exercises and their objectives.

### Exercise 1: Invalid Grade Management
Creation of a Java application to validate student grades:
- **Classes**: `NoteInvalideException` and `Evaluateur`.
- **Features**:
    - Checking grades provided by users.
    - Throwing a `NoteInvalideException` if the grade is outside the valid range (0-100).

### Exercise 2: Inadequate Speed Management
Development of a Java application to evaluate a vehicle's speed:
- **Classes**: `TropViteException` and `Vehicule`.
- **Features**:
    - Testing the speed of a vehicle.
    - Throwing a `TropViteException` if the speed exceeds a certain limit (90 km/h).

### Exercise 3: Invalid Square Root Management
Creation of a Java application to calculate the square root of a number:
- **Classes**: `RacineCarreException` and `Calculateur`.
- **Features**:
    - Checking the validity of a number for calculating its square root.
    - Throwing a `RacineCarreException` if the number is negative.

## Execution Instructions
1. **Clone the repository**: `git clone [GitHub repository URL]`
2. **Compile Java classes**: Navigate to each exercise directory and compile the Java files.
3. **Run the main program**: Each exercise contains a class with a `main` method to test the features.
